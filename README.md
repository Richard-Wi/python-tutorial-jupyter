# Python-tutorial-jupyter

An interactive tutorial for working with python, made with jupyter notebooks.

There is also going to be a binder, if I can manage to make one.

The tutorial is in german and concerns itself with variables, conditions, for/while loops, how to define and use functions and import libraries.
